ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have attracted increasing attention in recent years because of their broad range of applications in city security, military reconnaissance, disaster rescue, and so on. As one of the critical algorithms in the field of artificial intelligence, object tracking greatly improves the working efficiency of UAVs. However, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) object tracking still faces many challenges. UAV objects provide limited textures and contours for feature extraction due to their small sizes. Moreover, to capture objects continuously, a UAV camera must constantly move with the object. The above two reasons are usual causes of object-tracking failures. To this end, we propose an end-to-end discriminative tracker called TMDiMP. Inspired by the self-attention mechanism in Transformer, a novel memory-aware attention mechanism is embedded into TMDiMP, which can generate discriminative features of small objects and overcome the object-forgetting problem after camera motion. We also build a UAV object-tracking dataset with various object categories and attributes, named VIPUOTB, which consists of many video sequences collected in urban scenes. Our VIPUOTB is different from other existing datasets in terms of object size, camera motion speed, location distribution, etc. TMDiMP achieves competitive results on our VIPUOTB dataset and three public datasets, UAVDT, UAV123, and VisDrone, compared with state-of-the-art methods, thus demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed algorithm.},
