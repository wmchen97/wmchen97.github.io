As one of the critical algorithms in the field of artificial intelligence, object tracking greatly improves the working efficiency of UAVs. However, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) object tracking still faces many challenges. UAV objects provide limited textures and contours for feature extraction due to their small sizes. Moreover, to capture objects continuously, a UAV camera must constantly move with the object. The above two reasons are usual causes of object-tracking failures. To this end, we propose an end-to-end discriminative tracker called TMDiMP. Inspired by the self-attention mechanism in Transformer, a novel memory-aware attention mechanism is embedded into TMDiMP, which can generate discriminative features of small objects and overcome the object-forgetting problem after camera motion. We also build a UAV object-tracking dataset with various object categories and attributes, named VIPUOTB, which consists of many video sequences collected in urban scenes. Our VIPUOTB is different from other existing datasets in terms of object size, camera motion speed, location distribution, etc. TMDiMP achieves competitive results on our VIPUOTB dataset and three public datasets, UAVDT, UAV123, and VisDrone, compared with state-of-the-art methods, thus demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed algorithm.","tags":["Deep Learning"],"title":"TMDiMP: Temporal memory guided discriminative tracker for UAV object tracking","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Weiming Chen","Bing Han","Zheng Yang","Xinbo Gao"],"categories":[],"content":" ","date":1667088000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1667088000,"objectID":"b57f201c276937f66697d70a02ec4ada","permalink":"https://weimingchen.net/publication/2022-paper-mssdet/","publishdate":"2022-12-08T15:30:04+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2022-paper-mssdet/","section":"publication","summary":"Ships comprise the only and most important ocean transportation mode. Thus, ship detection is one of the most critical technologies in ship monitoring, which plays an essential role in maintaining marine safety. Optical remote-sensing images contain rich color and texture information, which is beneficial to ship detection. However, few optical remote-sensing datasets are open publicly due to the issue of sensitive data and copyrights, and only the HRSC2016 dataset is built for the ship-detection task. Moreover, almost all general object detectors suffer from the failure of multi-scale ship detection because of the diversity of spatial resolution and ship size. In this paper, we re-annotate the HRSC2016 dataset and supplement 610 optical remote-sensing images to build a new open source ship-detection benchmark dataset with rich multi-scale ship objects named the HRSC2016-MS dataset. In addition, we further explore the potential of a recursive mechanism in the field of object detection and propose a novel multi-scale ship-detection framework (MSSDet) in optical remote-sensing images. The success of detecting multi-scale objects depends on the hierarchical pyramid structure in the object-detection framework. However, the inherent semantic and spatial gaps among hierarchical pyramid levels seriously affect detection performance. To alleviate this problem, we propose a joint recursive feature pyramid (JRFP), which can generate semantically strong and spatially refined multi-scale features. Extensive experiments were conducted on the HRSC2016-MS, HRSC2016, and DIOR datasets. Detailed ablation studies directly demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed JRFP architecture and also showed that the proposed method has excellent generalizability. Comparisons with state-of-the-art methods showed that the proposed method achieves competitive performance, i.e., 77.3%, 95.8%, and 73.3% mean average precision accuracy on the HRSC2016-MS, HRSC2016, and DIOR datasets, respectively.","tags":["Deep Learning"],"title":"MSSDet: Multi-Scale Ship-Detection Framework in Optical Remote-Sensing Images and New Benchmark","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bing Han","Weiming Chen","Xinbo Gao","Zheng Yang","Xiaoyue Huang"],"categories":[],"content":"This is a Chinese invention patent, i.e.,\n韩冰, 陈玮铭, 高新波, 杨铮, 黄晓悦. 基于联合递归特征金字塔的多尺度目标检测方法. 申请号: 2022113394400. 申请日期: 2022年10月29日.\n","date":1667001600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1667001600,"objectID":"ea74803f64cd8eb27fcec915057a2305","permalink":"https://weimingchen.net/publication/2022-patent-%E5%9F%BA%E4%BA%8E%E8%81%94%E5%90%88%E9%80%92%E5%BD%92%E7%89%B9%E5%BE%81%E9%87%91%E5%AD%97%E5%A1%94%E7%9A%84%E5%A4%9A%E5%B0%BA%E5%BA%A6%E7%9B%AE%E6%A0%87%E6%A3%80%E6%B5%8B%E6%96%B9%E6%B3%95/","publishdate":"2022-12-08T16:28:57+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2022-patent-%E5%9F%BA%E4%BA%8E%E8%81%94%E5%90%88%E9%80%92%E5%BD%92%E7%89%B9%E5%BE%81%E9%87%91%E5%AD%97%E5%A1%94%E7%9A%84%E5%A4%9A%E5%B0%BA%E5%BA%A6%E7%9B%AE%E6%A0%87%E6%A3%80%E6%B5%8B%E6%96%B9%E6%B3%95/","section":"publication","summary":"This patent is under examination","tags":["Deep Learning"],"title":"A Multi-scale Object Detection Method Based on Joint Recursive Feature Pyramid","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bing Han","Weiming Chen","Ping Wang","Yannan Xiong","Yang Zhou","Weixiong Zhao"],"categories":[],"content":"This is a Chinese software copyright, i.e.,\n韩冰, 陈玮铭, 王平, 熊燕南, 周洋, 赵玮雄. 视觉影像标注系统V1.0. 软件著作权.\n","date":1667001600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1667001600,"objectID":"ce48b531585b34c8d62fc89bced0ada0","permalink":"https://weimingchen.net/publication/2022-patent-%E8%A7%86%E8%A7%89%E5%BD%B1%E5%83%8F%E6%A0%87%E6%B3%A8%E7%B3%BB%E7%BB%9F/","publishdate":"2022-12-08T16:38:28+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2022-patent-%E8%A7%86%E8%A7%89%E5%BD%B1%E5%83%8F%E6%A0%87%E6%B3%A8%E7%B3%BB%E7%BB%9F/","section":"publication","summary":"This paptent is applying.","tags":["Deep Learning"],"title":"Visual Image Annotation System V1.0","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yang Zhou","Bing Han","Xinbo Gao","Zheng Yang","Weiming Chen"],"categories":[],"content":"This is a Chinese paper, i.e.,\n周洋, 韩冰, 高新波, 杨铮, 陈玮铭. 基于注意力和三元损失的域自适应YOLO目标检测算法. 自动化学报.\n","date":1665792000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1665792000,"objectID":"a223c42962773cd3648f9c8e66e54001","permalink":"https://weimingchen.net/publication/2022-paper-%E5%9F%BA%E4%BA%8E%E6%B3%A8%E6%84%8F%E5%8A%9B%E5%92%8C%E4%B8%89%E5%85%83%E6%8D%9F%E5%A4%B1%E7%9A%84%E5%9F%9F%E8%87%AA%E9%80%82%E5%BA%94yolo%E7%9B%AE%E6%A0%87%E6%A3%80%E6%B5%8B%E7%AE%97%E6%B3%95/","publishdate":"2022-12-08T16:23:45+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2022-paper-%E5%9F%BA%E4%BA%8E%E6%B3%A8%E6%84%8F%E5%8A%9B%E5%92%8C%E4%B8%89%E5%85%83%E6%8D%9F%E5%A4%B1%E7%9A%84%E5%9F%9F%E8%87%AA%E9%80%82%E5%BA%94yolo%E7%9B%AE%E6%A0%87%E6%A3%80%E6%B5%8B%E7%AE%97%E6%B3%95/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper is under reviewing.","tags":["Deep Learning"],"title":"Domain Adaptive YOLO Object Detector Based on Attention and Triplet Loss","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Weiming Chen"],"categories":[],"content":"News 📌 Schedule 📅\nversion 0.4.0 is on the schedule. the second-round alpha test will start immediately after the releasement of version 0.4.0. 2022.12.06: the first-round alpha test was finished.\n2022.11.27: version 0.3.0 was released.\n2022.11.05: version 0.2.0 was released.\n2022.11.02: version 0.1.1 was released.\n2022.11.01: the Github repository was created (in private).\n2022.08.25: the idea of VAP was born.\nThis project aims to build a Visual Annotation Platform (VAP) for basic computer vision tasks.
